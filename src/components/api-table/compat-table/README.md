# Compatibility Table

The Compatibility Table component displays feature compatibility across platforms.

This component is a **presentational** component awaiting a data-fetching container. It serves as a precursor to the `<FetchingCompatTable>` (the internal implementation of `<APITable>` used in the docs).

## Usage

```tsx
// Import the data statically
import testData from '@lynx-js/lynx-compat-data/test/api.json';
import platformsData from '@lynx-js/lynx-compat-data/platforms/platforms.json';

<CompatTable
  query="test.api"
  data={testData.test.api}
  browsers={platformsData.platforms}
  locale="en-US"
/>;
```

Do note that directly using this component requires you to static-import the LCD data - which is less convenient to use than its dynamic counterpart - `<APITable />`.

Performance-wise, the static-imported `.json` will be bundled into the route-split `.js` chunk directly, increasing the client bundle size and the initial load time for CSR (client-side rendering). Though it also enables the table to be SSG (static-site generation)-ed into the initial html file.

## Development Notes

This component is ported from [yari (the MDN Web Docs)](https://github.com/mdn/yari/tree/main/client/src/document/ingredients/browser-compatibility-table), which reads data from [MDN BCD](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data).

### Naming

Most of the code is stayed untouched so you will still see `Browser` all over the place.

`LCD` is currently imported as `BCD` in the codebase. To make it work, we simply mapped the usage of `BCD.BrowserBlah` to `LCD.PlatformBlah`.

### Icons

Icon assets are copied into `assets/`. Because icon SVGs are loaded on-demand at runtime, we don't need to worry about having extra unused assets in the source.

Additionally, we downloaded some icons to represent Lynx platforms e.g. `icon-android`, `icon-ios`, `icon-web`, etc.

### Styles

We copied the dependent SCSS files to `ui/`. One concern is that the table is styled with global selectors which might cause conflicts with other components. Luckily, most of them are `bc-` prefixed and doesn't seem to break anything right now.

The rendered table naturally inherits styles from the Lynx website e.g. font sizes and `code` formats, which looks different from the MDN web docs in a good way. We also added some extra tweaks to make it fit with Lynx's docs website.

### TODO

- [ ] Further adjust the UI texts to say Lynx stuffs.
