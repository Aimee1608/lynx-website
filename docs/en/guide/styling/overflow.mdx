# Overflow and Scrolling Behavior in Lynx

The [overflow](/api/css/properties/overflow) property defines how the element displays content that overflows its boundaries.
The value `visible` will display the content that overflows the element's edges, while `hidden` will hide it.

## Overflow and Clipping

While using `overflow` in Lynx, please care about the difference from the specification in CSS. The `overflow` property in Lynx only takes two possible values, `visible` and `hidden`.

- `hidden`

  In the CSS specification, both `clip` and `hidden` indicates that the content overflows the element's bounds will be hidden. Users can not dragging the content to make it scroll.
  But when the value is `hidden`, the content can still be scrolled by program via `scrollLeft` attributes and etc.

  In Lynx, whether the element is scrollable is not controlled by `overflow`. We have two scrollable container elements `<scroll-view>` and `<list>`. When set `overflow: hidden` to a
  unscrollable element (e.g. `<view>`), it acts like `clip` in CSS specification, the content overflows the element's bounds will be hidden and can not be scrolled by both user interactions and programs.

- `visible`

  Set the value to `visible` when you want to display the contents overflows the element's bounds.

<table
  rules="none"
  align="center"
  width="100%"
  style={{ tableLayout: 'fixed' }}
>
  <thead align="center">
    <th colSpan={2}>
      <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
        The red rect is a sub element of the cyan rect in the images below.
      </span>
    </th>
  </thead>
  <tr style={{ height: '275px' }}>
    <td style={{ padding: '15px' }}>
      <center>
        <img
          src="/assets/doc/style-guide-overflow-visible.png"
          style={{ width: '70%', aspectRatio: '1/1' }}
        />
        <br />
        <span>
          The red rect overflows the cyan rect is shown when `visible`
        </span>
      </center>
    </td>
    <td style={{ padding: '15px' }}>
      <center>
        <img
          src="/assets/doc/style-guide-overflow-hidden.png"
          style={{ width: '70%', aspectRatio: '1/1' }}
        />
        <br />
        <span>
          The red rect overflows the cyan rect is clipped when `hidden`
        </span>
      </center>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Scrolling

If you want the content that overflows the element's boundaries to be scrollable, please use the scrollable elements [`<scroll-view>`](/api/elements/built-in/scroll-view) or [`<list>`](/api/elements/built-in/scroll-view).

- `<scroll-view>`: A single-column scrollable component that uses the [linear](guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx) layout.
- `<list>`: A high-performance scrollable component that supports multiple columns.

Except for `<list>` and `<scroll-view>`, other elements are not scrollable. In Lynx, the overflow property does not have the value `scroll`.

When `overflow` is applied to a scrollable element:

- `hidden`

  Content will be clipped at the edge of the element, but content can be scrolled by both user interaction and programs.

- `visible`

  Content will not be clipped at the edge of the element, and it can still be scrolled by both user interaction and programs. The area that responds to user interaction is the size of the element, which will not be expanded.

<table
  rules="none"
  align="center"
  width="100%"
  style={{ tableLayout: 'fixed' }}
>
  <thead>
    <th colSpan={2}>
      <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
        The cyan rect is a `<scroll-view>` and the red rect is its sub element.
      </span>
    </th>
  </thead>
  <tr style={{ height: '275px' }}>
    <td style={{ padding: '15px' }}>
      <center>
        <img
          src="/assets/doc/style-guide-scroll-hidden.gif"
          style={{ width: '70%', aspectRatio: '1/1' }}
        />
        <br />
        <span>The red rect can not overflow the cyan rect, but it can be scrolled when `hidden`</span>
      </center>
    </td>
    <td style={{ padding: '15px' }}>
      <center>
        <img
          src="/assets/doc/style-guide-scroll-visible.gif"
          style={{ width: '70%', aspectRatio: '1/1' }}
        />
        <br />
        <span>The red rect can overflow the cyan rect and be scrolled when `visible`</span>
      </center>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
