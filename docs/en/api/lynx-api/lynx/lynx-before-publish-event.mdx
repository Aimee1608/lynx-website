# BeforePublishEvent

`lynx.beforePublishEvent` is used to register/remove listening for a certain `DOM` event.

## Instance methods

[`BeforePublishEvent.add()`](./lynx-before-publish-event/before-publish-event-add.mdx)

Register a listener for a `DOM` event.

[`BeforePublishEvent.remove()`](./lynx-before-publish-event/before-publish-event-remove.mdx)

Remove listening for a `DOM` event.

## Example

Register/remove listening for a certain `DOM` event.

```tsx
//Register to listen for the tap event
lynx.beforePublishEvent.add('tap', this.handleTap);

//Remove monitoring of tap event
lynx.beforePublishEvent.remove('tap', this.handleTap);
```

## Precautions

Since this is an aspect interface on the `JS` side, the `DOM` element needs to be bound to the corresponding event and triggered, so that the aspect interface can listen to the `DOM` event.
