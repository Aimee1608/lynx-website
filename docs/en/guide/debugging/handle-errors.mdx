# Handle Errors in Lynx

## Recognize Errors in Tools

When you are developing Lynx apps, you may encounter various types of errors that are designed to notify you the unexpected situations that have just happened.

For example, if the bundle file is broken, you'll see:

<img
  src="./assets/error_invalid_bundle.png"
  alt="Bundle is broken"
  width="20%"
/>

Also, sometimes when your JavaScript code contains an TypeError:

<img src="./assets/error_syntax.png" alt="Syntax error" width="20%" />

Sometimes, a [native module](guide/spec.html#nativemodules) is called with a wrong number of arguments:

<img src="./assets/error_wrong_args.png" alt="Wrong arguments" width="20%" />

With DevTool or LogBox, you shall easily recognize them.

## LogBox

You've already seen it above - the in-app tool that displays errors.

import base64_notify from './assets/logbox_message.jpeg?inline';
import base64_red from './assets/logbox_box.png?inline';

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'flex-start', gap: '10px' }}>
  <img
    src={base64_notify}
    alt="LogBox notification"
    style={{ width: '40%', height: '40%', margin: 'auto 0' }}
  />
  <img src={base64_red} alt="LogBox red" width="30%" />
</div>

It's convenient for a quick overview and lets you know what's happening.
However, for development purposes, we recommend using DevTool Desktop Application with more features and a better interactive experience.

## Handle Errors in Code

Now let's try to do something with the errors.

You may want to have an overall understanding of the [errors](api/errors/lynx-error) first if you want to handle them in your code.

And then, here is an example of handling error [301](api/errors/error-code.html#eb_resource_image-301) in code:

```tsx
const ImageErrorExample = () => {
  const [isImageError, setImageError] = useState(false);
  const handleImageError = (event: ErrorEvent) => {
    setImageError(true);
    console.log('Image loaded error:', JSON.stringify(event));
  };
  if (isImageError) {
    return <view />;
  }
  return (
    <view>
      <image
        className="my-image"
        src={'error url'}
        binderror={handleImageError}
      />
    </view>
  );
};
```

In order for developers to quickly categorize an error and figure out how to deal with it, we have summed up all of them and made a [list](api/errors/error-code), including the error code, description, level, fix suggestion, etc.

Just help yourself!
